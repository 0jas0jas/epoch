# Random Word Tournament

On the Epoch registration form, we've been collecting three random words from each participant. For example:

```
computer, music, yay!
```

I propose we make a list of all these, sort through them, (potentially) add some verbs and then run a tournament of sorts.

Our theme will be a four word phrase. Attendees will vote to select each word in that phrase from a sub-section of the random words submitted by attendees.

Here's an example of how the tournament would work:

**Round 1**

Words to choose:

| Stupid | Magical | Supernatural | Chaotic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The votes are in from participants, they've choosen **Chaotic**.

Our prompt is currently _Chaotic XXX XXX XXX_.

**Round 2**

Words to choose:

| Creations | Adventures | Mayhem | Stories |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The votes are in from participants, they've choosen **Creations**.

Our prompt is currently _Chaotic Creations XXX XXX_.

**Round 3**

Words to choose:

| That | With | Running | Without |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The votes are in from participants, they've choosen **Without**.

Our prompt is currently _Chaotic Creations Without XXX_.

**Round 4**

Words to choose:

| Meaning | Documentation | Windows | Sleep |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The votes are in from participants, they've choosen **Meaning**.

Our prompt ends up as _Chaotic Creations Without Meaning_.

OK... so I hope that slightly staged example helped a little bit! We would curate the words a little better and all but that's basic idea.

I'm putting this idea out there because I think:

* it would be a fun way of engaging the attendees with the prompt
* it would lead to some wacky prompts and therefore wacky projects
* no one knows what will happen (incl. organisers) before the tournament
